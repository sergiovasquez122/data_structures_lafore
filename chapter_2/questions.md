1. Insertin an item into an unordered array
	1. takes time proporitonal to the size of the array
	2. requires multiple comparisons
	3. requires shifting order items to make room
	4. takes the same time no matter how many items there are

**d takes the same time no matter how many items there are**

2. true or false: when you delete and item from an unordered array, in most case you shift other items to fill in the gap

**true**

3. In an unordered array, allowing duplicates
	1. Increases times for all operations
	2. Increases search times in some situations
	3. always increases insertion times
	4. sometimes decreases insertion times

**false**

5. Creating an array in java requires using the keyword **new** 

6. If class A is going to use class B for something, then 
	1. Class A's methods should be easy to understand
	2. It's prefereable if class B communicates with the program's user
	3. The more cocmplex operations should be placed in class A
	4. The more work that class B can do, the better

**4**

7. When class A is using class B for something, the methods and fields class A can access in Class B are called Class b's **Interface**

8. Ordered arrays, compared with unordered arrays, are 
	1. much quicker at deletion
	2. quicker at insertion

	1. How the speed of an algorithm relates to the number of items
	2. the running time of an algorithm for a given size data structure
	3. the running time of an algorithm for a given number of items
	4. how the size of a data structure relates to the number of items

**1**

15. O(1) means a process operates in **constant** time

16. Either variables or primitive types of **objects** can be placed in an array
