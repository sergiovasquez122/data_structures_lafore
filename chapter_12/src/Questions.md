1. What does the term complete mean when applied to trees?
    1. All the necessary data has been inserted.
    2. All the rows are filled with nodes, except the possibly the bottome one.
    3. All existing nodes contain data.
    4. The node arrangement satisfies the heap condition.
**2**    
2. What does the term weakly ordered mean when applied to heaps?
**the left and right child are both less than or equal to the root of any subheap**
3. A nodes is always removed from the **root**

4. To "trick up" a node in a descending heap mean
    1. to repeatedly exchange it with its parent until it's larger than its parent.
    2. to repeatedly exchange it with its child until it's larger than its child.
    3. to repeatedly exchange it with its child until it's smaller than its child
    4. to repeatedly exchange it with its parent until it's smaller than its parent.
**a**    
5. A heap can be represented by an array because a heap
    1. is completed
    2. is weakly ordered.
    3. is a binary tree
    4. satisfies the heap condition

**1**
6. the last node in a heap is
    1. always a left child
    2. always a right child
    3. always on the bottom row.
    4. never less than its sibling
**4**
7. Insertion into a descending heap involves trickle __
**linked list**
8. Insertion into a descending heap involves trickle **up** 

9. Heapsort involves
    1. removing data from a heap and then inserting it again.
    2. inserting data into a heap and then removing it.
    3. copying data from one heap to another.
    4. copying data from the array representing a heap to the heap.
**b**   
10. How many arrays, each big enough to hold all the data, does it take to sort a heap?
**1**
