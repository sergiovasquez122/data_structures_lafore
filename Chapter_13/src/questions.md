1. In a graph, an **edge** connects two **vertices**
2. How do you tell, by looking at its adjacency matrix, how many edges there are in an undirected graph **the number of ones in a graph divided by 2**
3. In a game simulation, what graph entity corresponds to a choice about what choice to make?**vertex**
4. A directed graph is on in which
    1. you must follow the minimum spanning tree
    2. you must go rom vertex A to vertex B to vertex C and so on
    3. you can go in only one direction from on given vertex to another
    4. you can go in only one direction on any given path
    **c**
5. If an adjacency matrix has rows {0, 1, 0, 0}, {1, 0, 1, 1}, {0,1, 0, 0}, and {0, 1, 0, 0} what is the corresponding adjaceny list
6. A minimum spanning tree is a graph in which
    1. the number of edges connecting all the vertices is as small as possible
    2. the number of edges is equal to the number of vertices
    3. all unnecessary vertices have been removed
    4. every combinations of two vertices is connected by the minimum number of edges
    **a**
7. How many different minimum spanning trees are there in an undirected graph of three vertices and three edges **3**
8. An undirected graph must have a cycle if
    1. any vertex can be reached from some other vertex
    2. the number of paths is greater than the number of vertices
    3. the number of edges is equal to the number of vertices
    4. the number of paths is less than the number of edges
9. A DAG is a graph with no cycles
10. Can a minimum spanning tree for an undirected graph have cycles?**false**
11. True or False: There may be many correct topological sorts for a given graph**true**
12. Topological sorting results in
    1. vertices arranged so the directed edge all go in the same direction
    2. vertices listed in order of increasing number of edges from the beginning vertex
    3. vertices arranged so A precedes B, which precedes C, an so on
    4. vertices listed so that ones later in the list are downstreams from the ones earlier
13. What is a DAG? **Directed acylic graph**
14. can a tree have cycles?**no**
15. What evidence does the topological sort use to deduce that a graph has a cycle? **if all vertices in a graph have a vertex**
