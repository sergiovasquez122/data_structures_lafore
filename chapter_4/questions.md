1. Suppose you push 10, 20, 30, and 40 onto the stack.
    then you pop three items. which one is left on the stack?
    **10 is on the stack**
    
2. Which of the following is true
    1. The pop operation on a stack is considerably simpler than the remove operation on a queue
    2. The contents of a queue can wrap around, while those of a stack cannot
    3. The top of a stack corresponds to the front of a queue
    4. In both the stack and the queue, items removed in sequence are taken from increasingly high index cells in the array
   **2** 
3. What do LIFO and FIFO mean?
**LIFO mean 'Last In First out' and FIFO means FIFO means 'First In First out'**

4. True or false: A stack or a queue often serves as the underlying mechanism on which an ADT arrays is based? **False**

5. Assume an array is numbered with index 0 on the left. A queue representating a line of movie-goers, with the first to arrive numbered 1, has teh ticked windown on the right. then
    1. there is no numerical correspondence between the index numbers and the movie-goers number
    2. the array index numbers and the movie goer numbers increase in
    opposite left-right directions
    3. the array index numbers correspond numerically to the location in the line of movie-goers
    4. the movie-goers and th items in the array move in the same direction

6. As other items are inserted and removed, does a particular item in a queue move along the array from lower to higher indices, or higher to lower?

7. Suppose you insert 15, 25, 35, and 45 into a queue. Then you can remove three items. Which one is left? **45**

8. True or False: pushing and popping items on a stack and inserting and removing items in a queue all take O(N) time **false**

9. A queue might be used to hold
    1. The items to be sorted in an insertion sort
    2. Reports of a variety of imminent attacks on the star ship enterprise
    3. keystrokes made by a computer user writing a letter
    4. symbols in an algebraic expression being evaluated
   **3** 
10. Inserting an item into a typical priority queue takes what big O time? **O(N) given ordered array implementation**

11. The term priority in a priority queue means that
    1. the highest priority item are inserted first
    2. the programmer must prioritize access to the underlying array
    3. the underlying array is sorted by teh priority of the items
    4. the lowest priority items are deleted first
    
12. True or False: At least one of the methods in the pq uses a linear search**True**

13. One difference between a priority queue and an ordered array is that
    1. the lowest priority item cannot be extracted easily from the array as it can from the priority queue
    2. the array must be ordered while the priority queue must not be
    3. the highest priority item can be extraced easily from the priority queue but not from the array
    4. all of the above
   **2** 
14. suppose you based a priority queue class on the OrdArray Class. This will buy you binary search search capability. If you wanted the best performance for your prioirty queue, would you need to modify the ordarry class
**You would only need a method to find the minimum value**

15. A priority queue might be used to hold
    1. passengers to be picked up by a taxi from different parts of the city
    2. keystrokes maded at a computer keyboard
    3. squares on a chessboard in a game program
    4. planets in a solar system simulation
