1. The weight in a weighted graph is a property of the graph's **edges**
2. In a weighed graph, the minimum spanning tree tries to minimize the
    1. the number of edges from the starting vertex to a specified vertex
    2. the number of edges connecting all the vertices
    3. the total weight of the edges from the starting vertex to a specified vertex
    4. the total weight of edges connecting all the vertices
**4**
3. true or false: The weight of the MST depends on the starting vertex **false**
4. In the MST algorithm, what is removed from the priority queue? **the cheapest edge**
5. In the cable TV example, each edge added to the MST connects
    1. the starting vertex to an adjacent vertex
    2. an already-connected city to an unconnected city.
    3. the current vertex to an adjacent vertex
    4. two cities with offices
**2**
6. the mst algorithm "prunes" an edge from the list when the edge lead to a vertex that **already connected with lower weight**
7. true or false: the shortest path problem must carried out on a directed graph **false**
8. dijkstra algorithm finds the shortest path
    1. from one specified vertex to all other vertices
    2. from one specified vertex to another specified vertex
    3. from all vertices to all other vertices that can be reached along one edge
    4. from all vertices to all other vertices that can be reached along multiple edges
**1**
9. true or false: The rule in dikstra's algorithm is to always put in the tree the vertex that is closest to the starting vertex **true**
10. In the railroad fares example, a fringe town is one
    1. to which the distance is known but from which no distances are known
    2. which is in the tree
    3. to which the distance is known and which is in the tree
    4. which is completely unknown
**1**
11. the all-pairs shortest-path problems involves finding the shortest path
    1. from the starting vertex to ever other vertex
    2. from every vertex to every other vertex
    3. from teh starting vertext to every other vertex that is one edge-away
    4. from every vertex to every other vertex that is on or more edges away
**2**
12. floyd's algorithm is to weighted graphs what **warshall** is to unweighted graphs
13. floyd's algorithm uses the **adjacency matrix** representation of a graph
14. what is an approximate big o time for an attempt to solve the knight's tour **2^n**
15. in figure 14.13, is the route ABCEDA the minimum solution for the traveling salesman problem **no**
